## Overview 🌐
XRPL DECYPHER is an information and education platform tailored towards exploring the use cases and utilities that projects and companies building in the XRP Ledger have to offer. The XRPL DECYPHER platform seeks to educate and inform new and existing XRPL Users about the XRPL Community and technologies. Bloggers and Vloggers also have a role in educating and informing people on the platform. XRPL integrations like payment request, wallet sign-in, and NFT minting will make this platform blockchain-based. It is a not-for-profit endeavour to educate the Next 1 Billion XRPL Users.

## OUR Codes/Libraries
Our Codes are in Python and JavaScript programming languages. We used existing XRPL libraries like xumm js SDK and xrpl-py SDK. Our platform allows XUMM and Crossmark Plugin. Our scripts create XRP and XRPL Token payment requests and tracking, NFT minting and tracking, and Wallet login.

## COC NFTs 🎨
Certificate of Completion NFTs is a Decentralized proof of participation for users who read the articles on the DECYPHER Education. They are non-transferable XLS-20 NFTs attached to each Article on the Educational sector. Users will be white-listed to mint these NFTs after answering questions related to the topic discussed. Projects and companies can use these NFTs to track users who know about their enterprises, allowing them to make the necessary provisions, rewards, and recognitions.

## Conclusion 📝
For the platform to run, we need host services for the website and our XRPL codes, a Database for storing information (NFT Data, emails, articles, videos, and XRPL transactions), UI/UX design, and Web development services. 
The XRPL DECYPHER platform will provide quality and comprehensive knowledge to users about the utilities and use cases on the XRP Ledger. 
We have a few sample articles in our medium page. https://linktr.ee/xrpl_decypher/

The XRPL DECYPHER platform is an XRPL Believers and Enthusiasts venture. Above the code and the education, we seek to make other XRPL Users 589 steps ahead of the Crypto space.
